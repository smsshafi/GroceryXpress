GroceryXpress is a prototype for a web platform that lets grocery stores provide a more interactive online shopping experience for their customers.

Overview:

The platform is created in PHP and supported with a MySQL backend.

Pre-reqs:

PHP 5 or above
MySQL 5 or above

Instructions:

Run your favourite local webserver (Apache or Nginx) with PHP 5 and MySQL.

secure.php contains the MySQL database credentials. Set your database name there, and then create a database with that name.

The tables for the database are stored in database_dump.sql (with some test data). Import this into your database.

localsettings.php contains the root URL that the platform uses. It is currently pointing to the live site. You may want to point it instead to a local dev server running on your machine.

siteconfig.php contains other useful settings that you may have to change.
